# Credential-to-Controller-A-Four-Hour-Attack-Chain

## Objective

To analyze a multi‑stage attack chain that progressed from initial credential access to domain controller interaction within four hours. This project demonstrates my ability to follow an end‑to‑end intrusion, review authentication logs, identify privilege escalation behavior, and document findings using a structured SOC investigation workflow.
It also highlights my growing experience using Microsoft Defender XDR to correlate alerts, review device timelines, and validate suspicious activity.


### Skills Learned

- Understanding how attackers move from credential access to lateral movement
- Identifying suspicious authentication patterns (failed logons, unusual logon types, new account creation)
- Reviewing Windows Security Logs for account activity, privilege escalation, and Kerberos behavior
- Using Microsoft Defender XDR to investigate alerts, analyze device timelines, and correlate events
- Recognizing indicators of credential misuse and unauthorized access attempts
- Correlating events across multiple hosts to build a timeline of attacker actions
- Mapping activity to MITRE ATT&CK techniques (Credential Access, Lateral Movement, Privilege Escalation)
- Strengthening investigation structure: verify → correlate → conclude
- Improving documentation clarity for SOC‑style reporting


### Tools Used

- Microsoft Defender XDR – alert investigation, device timeline review, correlation of suspicious activity
- Windows Event Viewer – authentication logs, account activity, and security events
- Sysmon – process creation, network connections, and system activity visibility
- Windows Defender – alert context and threat detection signals
- PowerShell – understanding command execution and script behavior
- Splunk (Fundamentals) – SIEM searching, correlation, and detection logic
- CyberChef – decoding and quick data analysis
- VirusTotal – validating file and hash reputation
- Notepad++ – log parsing, note‑taking, and documentation
